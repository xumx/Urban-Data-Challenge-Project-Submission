A City's Heartbeat
==================


"A City's Heartbeat" is a web-based interactive visualization using Geneva's dataset.


This project has three main features. Firstly, we transformed the transportation dataset into a datacube format, which allows us to render big, timeseries data in the client. A playback of tram movements over a 2 day period allows us to "feel the pulse" of the city.


Feature two aims to visualize the volume of passengers over time. By using CSS 3, we utilised 2Â½ dimension to illustrate the passenger volume in each tram station. A complimentary D3 line graph plots the overall volume for the entire city. This visualization is our interpretation of the city's "blood pressure".


In the third feature, we bring users into the 3rd Dimension by taking them on a tour of the real Geneva city's tram routes. Users will experience the journey through a realistic 3D environment, which adds context to the previous two visualization.
